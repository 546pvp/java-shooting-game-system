# java shooting game system

I am still learning how to code, so I made this little project as my review of classes.
<hr>


## Files
(all files are located in ***src***)

**Main.java** = main function of the program, serves as little explanation.
**Player.java** = is file for the *Player* class, it has all the Player functions in it.
**Weapon.java** = is file for the *Weapon* logic, shooting, reloading and variables.
